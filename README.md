# Group 2 Midterm Project Report (30 points)

## GOAL

3 goals
1. scrape player data
2. use data extraced to find any interesting findgs/trends
3. regression anlaysis to see correlation between variable x and y.

The main goal of our analysis is three-folds. One is to scrape data of the top 30 earners in the NBA during the 2021-2022 season from ESPN website. Second, we use the data we extracted to see if there are any interesting findings/trends between the different variables. Lastly, we run a basic regression to see if there are any correlation between variables x and y, which feeds into potential extensions of our analysis or further areas for more research.


## DATA

If you only execute *main.py*, you can get all datas which is the samea as what we can get.

### Sources
We collected datas from ESPN website in the following.
*1. The ranking of the NBA players salaries 
	http://www.espn.com/nba/salaries/_/year/2022/seasontype/1
*2. The bio pages of each NBA players' detailed inforamtion.	
	For example, Stephen Curry'S detailed information is there.
	https://www.espn.com/nba/player/bio/_/id/3975/stephen-curry

### Collection Methods
We adopted three steps through collecting datas.
As we mentioned above, you only execute *main.py* if you want to execute three steps.


1. Collect the ranking of the NBA players salaries and the each player [scrape_ranking.py/scrape_ranking_pages.py]
	- Using request package, we got the html data from the page of ranking of salaries 2021-2022
	  For example, http://www.espn.com/nba/salaries/_/year/2022/seasontype/1
	- Using beatuiful soup package, we got *ranking, name, team, salarly, the link of player'S detailed*
	- Also, from the player's link, we got players' *id* which was given by ESPN website. This will be used to merge datas later. 
	- Finally, we created CSV.file named **results_players.csv** from these data.


2. Collect each player's detailed information from each bio pages [scrape_player.py/scrape_player_pages.py]
	- Using request package, we got the html data from each player's site
	  For example, https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3975/stephen-curry
	- Using beautiful soup package, we got *name, position, height, weight, age, assist, pts*
	- Similarly to 1.m, from the player's link, we got players' *id* which was given by ESPN website. 
	- Finally, we created CSV.file named **results_player.csv**

3. Merged between ranking data and player's detailed data[main.py]
	- After 1. 2. steps, we read csv files **results_players.csv** and **results_players.csv**.
	- We set these two datas's index is *id*, which means two data will be consistent in merge.
	- And, we merged two datas into one data based on *id*.
	- Finally, we created CSV.file named **results_integrated.csv** from merged data.


Note: when we dealt with datas, we used pandas package to do this easier.

	Equation:

### Limitations of analysis

### Extension of our analysis
1. extend number of players 30 -> 100 or possibly more
2. extend to multiple seasons instead of one.
3. add more variables: team, weight, rebounds, experience (# of seasons), draft info, etc
3. run various regression analyses and possibly use STATA or R, or even python package if there is one (instead of excel)


## REPRODUCIBILITY
- Instructions to rerun that analysis in the README.md (from takehiro)
