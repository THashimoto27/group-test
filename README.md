# Group 2 Midterm Project Report (30 points)

## GOAL

3 goals
1. scrape player data
2. use data extraced to find any interesting findgs/trends
3. regression anlaysis to see correlation between variable x and y.

The main goal of our analysis is three-folds. One is to scrape data of the top 30 earners in the NBA during the 2021-2022 season from ESPN website. Second, we use the data we extracted to see if there are any interesting findings/trends between the different variables. Lastly, we run a basic regression to see if there are any correlation between variables x and y, which feeds into potential extensions of our analysis or further areas for more research.

	Equation:
		(SALARY_i ) ̂=β_0+β_1 AGE_i+β_2 PPG_i+β_3 APG_i+β_4 Height_i+β_5 Weight_i+ϵ_i


### Limitations of analysis

### Extension of our analysis
1. extend number of players 30 -> 100 or possibly more
2. extend to multiple seasons instead of one.
3. add more variables: team, weight, rebounds, experience (# of seasons), draft info, etc
3. run various regression analyses and possibly use STATA or R, or even python package if there is one (instead of excel)


## REPRODUCIBILITY
